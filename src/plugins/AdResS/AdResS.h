/**
 * With the introduction of AdResS to ls1-MarDyn the simulation class owns two particle containers,
 * each of which handle their own respective domain.
 * Simulation::_moleculeContainerAlt contains particles in a CG resolution.
 * This plugin moves and transforms molecules upon entering a domain of another resolution.
 * Currently supports only split domain along x-Axis
 *
 * BEWARE:
 * When creating components for AdResS,
 * the full particle component must have id n,
 * the hybrid component id n+1 and the CG component id n+2!
 * The names of the components must be prefixed with "FP_", "H_" or "CG_"!
 * The hybrid component must first contain all CG parts with mass = 0 and then the FP part.
 * Regions cannot overlap, otherwise forces are computed multiple times.
