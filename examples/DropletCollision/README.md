# Droplet Collision

## Description
Two spherical liquid droplets (LJTS) are set in vapor next to each other. A macroscopic velocity was assigned to them so that they will collide eventually.

## Setup
The provided script will setup the initial checkpoint including the two droplets. To make the script run, make sure that the ls1 python toolbox ppls1 works properly. Change the paths in the python script according to the present system.

## Steps
The script will execute three steps, represented in the specified working folder as `s1_Bulk-Liquid`, `s2_Droplet-Equi`, and `s3_Droplet_Collision`.
1. Equilibration of a bulk liquid
2. Bulk liquid is replicated and a droplet is cut out of it. An equilibration simulation for the droplet is executed. Make sure, the steps of equilibration were sufficient (check `Upot` over timesteps).
3. The droplet is duplicated and a macroscopic velocity is assigned respectively.
4. The production simulation as to be started manually from the folder `s3_Droplet_Collision`. Before, the whole simulation folder could be copied to a supercomputer.

## Variability
Just change the parameters like radius or velocity in the python script. The script should take care about the rest.
